Write lots of code for creating page
single web page
security feature limited
some complexity
static and plain pages can create
editing the modules the seperately.
not centeralised--> in case of JS it is centralized

%%%%%%%%%% Javascript %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
to program the behaviour of the page
Interactive
Interpreted Language(Compiler)
Runs on the client side- browser
Object based(Everything is documented as object)
Javascript is not Java
It is light weight 
It is known as scripting language
function,loops,data types,conditions,events,objects
We need the browser to run JS
Text Editor
Responsiveness(Adaptive in all devices)(Laptop,phones, tablets)
validate forms
can create animations, slideshows

%%%%%%%%% DOM %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Top down approach
Dynamically access and Update
Content, Structure and Style
Document
Object: Mobile
Property: attribute of Object
Function: It is the functions(For Mobile): Call(), SwitchOn(), SendMsg()
Property: color:blue, price:5000
Html->head(style)->body-> (div)->p,id
ID="myid"


getElementByID()
getElementByTagName(p)

Inner HTML Property: Content within the tag is inner html
<p id=="data"> Muskan Malhotra</p>
document.getElementById("data")

Two control statement:
1) condition statement: if, if-elese,switch
Based on expression passed, makes a decision
2) Iteration Statement: loops, while, do-while, for

Until and Unless the expression or conditons given is satisfied, the statement repeats

%%%%%%%% form validation %%%%%%%%%%%%
Arrays: collection of similar data types.
It has contiguous memory allocation
Stores the similar data types
Creating arrays in javascript: variable: stores the value
var country=["india","USA","Britain"]
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Types of Array:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Array Literal::: var name=['q','e','p']
var name = new array()
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::;Array Constructor::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::;;
var name = new Constructor()
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::;Array Methods::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
1) Concat method---> Array.concat(val1,val2,....valn)
2)Every()--> whether the goven eleemts are true or false(If it matches the correct sequence)
Arra.every(callback,argument)
3)fill()--> fills the specified static value
Array.fill(value)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: JS Event Handling :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::;;
Event: it gives trigger when user wants to make modification
1)OnBlur()--> When the user leaves an empty inout field
2)Onchange()--> when the user tries to change something|| when a user tries to open a form and enter the text into the form. slect the values from a dropdown list
