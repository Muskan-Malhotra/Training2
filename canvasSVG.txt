canva:
Introduced in html 5
HTML canvas eleemnt is used to draw graphics on web page
used for graphical designing
<canva>

## it uses some scripts 
# on the fly we can use it--> it makes the changes on the cliet side. After rendering!

It is an element. Like a container. _ basically Javascript
to draw graphics


SVG:
Scaler Vector Graphics
This was instroduced in 2001 Sptember By W3C-Consortium
To draw the images
We can draw using XML format on the browser
we can draw animation


Advantage over cnavas is it creates a good quality
No pixels
No breakage
XML based fully
Every element is available within the SVG DOM
Can attach the js event handler for an element
Each shape is an object

## WEB Storage:
store some of the details of web page in the browser memory itself
also known as dom  storage
supports persistent data storage in the web browser
storage size may vary browser to browser

Types of storage:
local storage:
Always present in the webpage even if the page is closed
not loseable

session storage:
loseable
for a particular session the data is stored
no persistency


Application Cache:
using the internet.
cache accessible without internet connection
A web application is cached and accessed without an internet connection
We can make use of a web application that will run without the internet connection by just creating a manifest file in our application.
Manifest file: a meta data file: containing the meta data

the content is the meta data: it descibes the data about the data.
It descibes the explanation. It gives a brief desciption. 


CSS:
cascading style sheets
Used to define styles for the web pages:
!) Design
@) Layout
#)Variations
$)Animation

What is css?
Used to format the layout of a web page
Add to html document in 3 ways:
1) inline
<h1 style="color:blue;">This is heading</h1>
2) internal - used in head and call it in the body through declaration in the head tag.
create everything in the head section

3)external

common way is the internal way.

CSS Selctors:
patterns used to select elemnts you want to give style
.class->.div->all the elements with class="doctor"
#id-> select the elements with id="name"
*->select all the element
elemetn-> <p>-> select all the <p> elements
5) :hover->:hover->selects links on mouse over
6):root->:root->select the documents root element 


###2D 
Two Dimensional Transform and 2D and 3D!
Understanding 2D tranformation(change in position and dimension)
3D  tranform properties
Transition
Animation

Transformation:
Transformation makes the object to change its size and position.

Transformation
css3-came with this ideas
css3 with awesome interaction
allows us to rotate, scale,skew
Both in 2D and 3D
css3 supports both

Need transform attribute
2D and 3D tranfromation methods
1) Translate(x,y): moving an element to the specified x and y axis
2) TranslateX(n) - according to the specified X axis
3) Translate Y(n) - movement to a specified Y axis
4)Rotate(angle) - turn an element clockwise/anti-clockwise(0 to 360 degree) angle
5)Scale(w,h) - used to adjust an eleement size by changing width and height.
6) ScaleX(n) - adjust for only the x axis
7)ScaleY(n)-adjust for only y axis
8)SkewX(angle)-slanting the elements- horizontally
9)SkewY(angle) - skew it vertically
10)Skew(x,y) - both the direction(horizontal+vertical)

%%%%%%%%%%%% 3D %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
helps the developers to make some real world applications

3D tranformation properties:
1) Transform origin: where I have to begin the transforamtion(left,right,top, etc)
2)Transform style(nest the object circle with the sqaure) - 
eg: outer 3D image 
	Flate and preserve:  merged object 
3)Perspective- Views (front view, side view)
4)Perspective Origin- where to start 

--webkit--4.3.0
code will run on google chrome web browser

%%%%%%%%%%% Transition %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Used to change the values over a specified duration and animation
1)Transition delay
2)Transition duration
3)Transition timing function
	Ease: slow at beginning --> fast----->slow at the end
	Linear: reamians in sam espeed through out

%%%%%%%%%% Animation %%%%%%%%%%%%
css3 animation are useful to make the changes in style gradually
To perform this animation @Keyframes keyword-implement the animation
@keyframes->used to specify what would happen at specific moments durng the animation
-animation_name - used to specify the name of the animation.
-keyframe_sector- from (0%){css style-optional}{100%}

Properties of animation!
1) animation_name: same as above
2) animation_duration: specify the duration of the animation to complete
3)animation_delay: used to specify the delay of the animation before starting
4) animation_direction: used to specify the direction(L-R) or (R-L)/reverse
Reverse- to make the animation play in the reeverse direction.
	Animation_play_state- play mode/pause mode(running/paused)
	Animation_iteration_count- used to specify the count of the animation i.e to be played. 
		To specify the number of times an animation has to be played! 
		If not speciffied so infinite
